# Text Extraction

DocuDesk provides text extraction capabilities for various document types, allowing you to search and analyze the content of your documents.

## Supported File Types

DocuDesk currently supports text extraction for the following file types:

### PDF Documents
- Files with `.pdf` extension
- Extracts text content and document metadata
- Supports both text-based and scanned PDFs

### Microsoft Word Documents
- Files with `.doc` and `.docx` extensions
- Extracts text content and document properties
- Supports both old and new Word formats

## How It Works

When you upload a document to DocuDesk, the system automatically:

1. Detects the file type
2. Extracts the text content
3. Extracts document metadata
4. Makes the content searchable

The extracted text and metadata are used for:
- Full-text search
- Document preview
- Content analysis
- Metadata display

## Using Extracted Text

### Search
You can search through your documents using the search bar. The search will look through:
- Document titles
- Extracted text content
- Document metadata

### Preview
When viewing a document, you can see the extracted text in the preview panel. This allows you to:
- Quickly scan document content
- Copy text for use elsewhere
- Verify document content

### Metadata
Document metadata is displayed in the document properties panel, showing information such as:
- Author
- Creation date
- Last modified date
- Document statistics

## Limitations

- Very large documents may take longer to process
- Some complex formatting may not be perfectly preserved
- Scanned documents require OCR to be searchable
- Password-protected documents cannot be processed

## Troubleshooting

If text extraction fails for a document:

1. Check if the file type is supported
2. Verify the file is not corrupted
3. Ensure the file is not password-protected
4. Check if the file size is within limits

If problems persist, contact your system administrator for assistance.
